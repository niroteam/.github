# Niro Team Security Policy ðŸ”’

## Introduction

At Niro Team, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of security to protect our organization's assets, data, and infrastructure. This security policy outlines the measures and guidelines that all members and contributors must adhere to in order to safeguard our systems and information.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all members, contributors, and third-party vendors who have access to Niro Team's systems, data, and resources. It encompasses all aspects of security, including but not limited to information security, network security, application security, and physical security.

## Information Security

1. *Confidentiality*: All sensitive information, including but not limited to user data, source code, and internal communications, must be treated as confidential and protected from unauthorized access or disclosure.
2. *Data Encryption*: Data in transit and at rest must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms to prevent interception or unauthorized access.
3. *Access Control*: Access to sensitive systems and data must be granted on a need-to-know basis and managed through secure authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC).
4. *Data Backup*: Regular backups of critical data must be performed to ensure data integrity and availability in the event of a security incident or system failure.

## Network Security

1. *Firewall Configuration*: Firewalls must be configured to restrict inbound and outbound traffic and prevent unauthorized access to our network infrastructure.
2. *Intrusion Detection and Prevention*: Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) must be implemented to detect and mitigate potential security threats and attacks in real-time.
3. *Network Segmentation*: Critical network assets and systems must be segmented to minimize the impact of security breaches and limit lateral movement by attackers.

## Application Security

1. *Secure Coding Practices*: Developers must follow secure coding practices and guidelines to mitigate common vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure deserialization.
2. *Vulnerability Management*: Regular security assessments and vulnerability scans must be conducted to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in our applications and infrastructure.
3. *Patch Management*: Security patches and updates for operating systems, software libraries, and third-party dependencies must be applied in a timely manner to address known security vulnerabilities.

## Physical Security

1. *Access Control*: Physical access to our facilities, server rooms, and data centers must be restricted to authorized personnel only, and access logs must be monitored and reviewed regularly.
2. *Environmental Controls*: Environmental controls such as temperature regulation, fire suppression, and power backup systems must be in place to protect our hardware and infrastructure from physical threats and disasters.

## Incident Response

1. *Reporting Incidents*: All security incidents, breaches, or suspected vulnerabilities must be reported immediately to the designated security team or point of contact.
2. *Investigation and Response*: A formal incident response plan must be in place to investigate security incidents, contain the impact, and implement remediation measures in a timely manner.
3. *Communication*: Clear and timely communication must be maintained with all relevant stakeholders, including internal teams, customers, and regulatory authorities, throughout the incident response process.

## Compliance

Niro Team is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards related to information security and privacy, including but not limited to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.

## Training and Awareness

Regular security awareness training and education programs must be conducted for all employees and contributors to ensure they are aware of their roles and responsibilities in maintaining the security of our organization.

## Enforcement

Violation of this security policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract, and legal consequences as applicable.

## Review and Update

This security policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in the threat landscape, technology landscape, and regulatory requirements. All members and contributors are responsible for staying informed about the latest revisions to this policy.
